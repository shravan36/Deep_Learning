I have implemented Mobilenet SSD Pretrained model to detect person in an image or video in python.
You can get the MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel model and MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt from below link
https://github.com/PINTO0309/MobileNet-SSD-RealSense/tree/master/caffemodel/MobileNetSSD
then download the codes and sample images and keep all the files in same filder ad run the code.
Run human_det_in_img.py to detect person in images.
Run human_det_in_vid.py to detect person in live video.
